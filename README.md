# A-Flip-Away-Escape-To-Reality-Unity-Build
A Flip Away: Escape to Reality is a 2D puzzle-based game that allows the player to switch between platformer and top-down states. A Flip Away aims to make learning fun and engaging by utilizing fundamental physics concepts to solve each stage.

## Project Description
