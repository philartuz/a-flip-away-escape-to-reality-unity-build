## Project Description
- This repository contains the build version of A Flip Away's Unity project, which was used as the final published version in the attached [itch.io](https://phloonn.itch.io/aflipaway) link in the repository.
- The whole project was made in Unity3D with the design assets created via Adobe Photoshop and Blender, and sounds assets from free resource libraries.

## Core Mechanics

- **State Switching**: Toggle between platformer and top-down movement modes.
- **Gravity Manipulation**: Different gravity behavior depending on the current state.
- **Gadget Use**:
  - **Wind Shield**: Counter wind currents to reach blocked areas.
  - **Grab Mechanic**: Push/pull objects to activate sensors.
- **Physics Applications**:
  - Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion
  - Aerodynamics
  - Buoyancy and Archimedes' Principle

## Educational Impact

Two rounds of playtesting were conducted with student participants to assess learning outcomes. Players took pre- and post-tests on physics topics.

- **Significant improvement** noted in understanding of **Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion** (p < 0.05).
- **Gameplay satisfaction** measured using GUESS-18 showed high marks in enjoyment, usability, and creative freedom.
- **Version 2.0** addressed player feedback with QoL features, redesigned levels, and technical fixes.

## ðŸ–¥System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11  
- **Processor**: Intel i5 or equivalent  
- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum  
- **Storage**: 60 MB  

---

## Playtesting & Results

- **Version 1.0** and **2.0** tested with college students.
- Improvements made between versions included better UI, pause menu, feedback indicators, and bug fixes.
- **Total GUESS-18 Score (v2.0):** 46.7/56  
- Qualitative feedback highlighted the game's creativity, engaging puzzles, and intuitive mechanics.
