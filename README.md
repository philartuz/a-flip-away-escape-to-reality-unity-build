# A-Flip-Away-Escape-To-Reality-Unity-Build
A Flip Away: Escape to Reality is a 2D puzzle-based game that allows the player to switch between platformer and top-down states. The player must switch between states and interact with the world each state has to offer in order to escape from the experiment they were forced into. Each state has its own unique set of mechanics that the player must use to solve the puzzles in each stage. A Flip Away aims to make learning fun and engaging by utilizing fundamental physics concepts to solve each stage.
